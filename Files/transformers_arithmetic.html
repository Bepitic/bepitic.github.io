        <h1>Machine Learning Model for Arithmetic Problem Solving using Transformers</h1>

        <p>
            I developed a machine learning project focused on building a model utilizing transformer architectures to
            accurately solve simple arithmetic problems. The goal of the project was to create a system that could
            effectively respond to questions related to arithmetic calculations, enabling automated problem-solving.
        </p>

        <p>
            Using a dataset containing various arithmetic questions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
            division problems, I trained a transformer-based model. Transformers are a state-of-the-art architecture in
            natural language processing and have been successfully applied to a wide range of tasks. I leveraged their
            ability to capture contextual dependencies and learn patterns within sequences of data.
        </p>

        <p>
            To train the model, I employed a supervised learning approach, where the model was provided with pairs of
            questions and corresponding correct answers. The dataset was preprocessed to convert the text-based
            questions into numerical representations suitable for training. The transformer model was then trained using
            gradient-based optimization techniques to minimize the prediction error.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through rigorous experimentation and fine-tuning of hyperparameters, I achieved a high level of accuracy in
            predicting correct responses to arithmetic questions. The model demonstrated excellent performance in
            handling various question types, including both single-step and multi-step problems. It was able to handle
            both numerical and word-based input formats, showcasing its versatility.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to the model development, I also implemented a user-friendly interface to interact with the
            trained model. The interface allows users to input arithmetic questions and receive accurate responses in
            real-time. This feature enhances the usability and accessibility of the system, making it practical for both
            educational and practical applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, this project showcases my proficiency in machine learning, natural language processing, and
            transformer architectures. It demonstrates my ability to design and implement effective models for
            problem-solving tasks, leveraging cutting-edge techniques to achieve accurate results.
