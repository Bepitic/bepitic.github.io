            <h2>Integrating Vision Large Language Models into Anomalib</h2>
            <p>During my time as a Software Engineer - Machine Learning in the Google Summer of Code program (May 2024 - Sep 2024), I worked on an exciting project with OpenVINO's Anomalib. My main focus was on integrating Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) into the Anomalib framework to achieve Zero/Few Shot anomaly detection models.</p>
            
            <h3>Project Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement VLLM integration within the Anomalib framework</li>
                <li>Develop Zero-Shot and Few-Shot learning capabilities for anomaly detection</li>
                <li>Optimize the performance of the integrated models</li>
                <li>Create comprehensive documentation and examples for future users</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Successfully integrated state-of-the-art VLLMs into Anomalib</li>
                <li>Developed a flexible architecture that supports both Zero-Shot and Few-Shot learning paradigms</li>
                <li>Achieved significant improvements in anomaly detection accuracy compared to traditional methods</li>
                <li>Contributed to the open-source community by making the integration publicly available</li>
                <li>Created extensive documentation, including tutorials and code examples</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges and Learning</h3>
            <p>Throughout the project, I faced several challenges, including optimizing the VLLM inference for real-time applications and ensuring compatibility with various datasets. These challenges provided valuable learning experiences in large-scale machine learning deployment and optimization techniques.</p>

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>The integration of VLLMs into Anomalib has opened up new possibilities for anomaly detection in various domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, and security. The Zero-Shot and Few-Shot capabilities allow for more flexible and adaptable anomaly detection systems, reducing the need for large, labeled datasets.</p>

            <p>Overall, my Google Summer of Code experience was incredibly rewarding, allowing me to contribute to cutting-edge machine learning technology while collaborating with talented developers from around the world.</p>
